# Generative (programmed) sketches

Nowadays generative is a loaded word, but this has nothing to do with generative AI. That shit 
be banned from this REPO. 

## This is a collection of generative art written in jscript. 

## To render an image, you open the index.html file with the desired script path designated as 'src'.

Lots of randomness is utilized, so everytime a script is rendered it ### will be different!!
