# Generative (programmed) sketches

Nowadays generative is a loaded word, but this has nothing to do with generative AI. That shit 
be banned from this REPO. 

## This is a collection of generative art written in jscript. 

## To render an image, you open the index.html file with the desired script path designated as 'src'.

Lots of randomness is utilized, so everytime a script is rendered the resulting image 
**will be different!!**

## Sources:
Utilizing the p5$_*$js package:

Check them out! 

## Concepts/inspo:
Natural landscapes and phenomena are a big inspiration. 
Been motivated on greyscale lineart because 
1) it's relatively straightforward to implement 
2) it's challenging to execute a concept with this limited setup and 
3) I like the 'x-ray' effect this gives and it's evocation of skeletal aesethic. 
Rocks are the bones of the earth after all.

## Current Collections:

### lighting:
Attempt to capture the drama of lightning bolts. Tricks were to use a lot of randomized direction
changes, segment length and quantity parameters. The jagged effect almost looks like a random walk.

### Ships:
Early collection, focused on experiments with framerate and geometry shading. The somewhat 3D looking polygons look like some sort of spaceship perhaps - hence the name.

### Stars
Some north star inspired images using the same straight line geometric style as for Ships.
